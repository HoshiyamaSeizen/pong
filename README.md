# pong

Ping pong like game visualization. There are balls generated in the inner and outer side of the box. Each ball goes through blocks of the opposite color but bounce from blocks of its color and paint them to opposite. So it looks like balls of different colors are bouncing in their own space.

It is possible to change speed of visualization, colors of both sides, amount of balls, width of the box. The game needs to be started again when the two last parameters are changed.

The amount of blocks of each color (and the percentages) are shown on the top of the screen.

The game is available at GitHub Pages: https://hoshiyamaseizen.github.io/pong/. You can also download the repository (or release archive) and launch <code>index.html</code> in the browser.
